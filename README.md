# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Bharath Gohrani, and I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from _Delhi Technological University_, based in New Delhi, India. I'm passionate about Data Science and Machine Learning and have recently begun on my journey as a programmer. My repositories consist of code I've built from coursework on Data Structures and Deep Learning.
